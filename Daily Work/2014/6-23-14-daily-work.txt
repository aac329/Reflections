Tried working with angular to create an editable field, however I couldn't figure out how to integrate it properly.

I then decided to move along and try making the previous edit option look nicer by changing the button types, position of button, and removing button group.

Put the inputs into form control divs to give them a bootstrappy feel, and sized them. Size will probably be changed in future.

Added a few breaks for spacing needs.

Decided to mess with the columns for the date, attachments, and campus code to make it look nicer.

Changed the title of the page to Technical Support like in the pdf.
