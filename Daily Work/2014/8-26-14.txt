Researched a ton and got some help from Duke. The checkboxes go to the player solution. Through using console.log, I found that the variable was passing through properly. I also researched into how closed captioning is added to videos. They're on/off value is set through "default" which must be put in a playlist, then passed into the setup of the jwplayer. Note, default must be in quotes. My only problem now is that "default" doesn't seem to be responding properly to it's assigned boolean variable. Once I figure that out, I can switch the variable to the checkbox variable. Using console.log I found out that the object does indeed change with the checkbox. So it seems to be working properly.
