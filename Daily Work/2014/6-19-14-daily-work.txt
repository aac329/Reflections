Didn't have any tasks this morning, so I went to codeacademy.com to practice some hands on javascript.

I learned how to:

write functions with parameters and call them
Write nested if, if else, and else if statements
How to write a for loop 

Got a task at 9:00 am

Researched angular-xeditable.
Found a couple of interesting tutorials and examples on jfiddle but nothing applicable yet.
Going to start implementing an editable form.
Started on the title. Will continue to work on it on Monday.
