Studied Javascript (ECMA) at Lynda.com

Learned about:

Arrays - var adam = [];
Array Methods - var adam = adam.reverse(), .join(), .sort();
Proper Notation - script tag belongs at end of body tag
JS operators - arithmetic, comparison, assignment, equality, strict equality, modulus

Went to codeacademy.com for more hands on javascript learning
