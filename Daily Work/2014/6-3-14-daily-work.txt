In ConnectSearchFilter.ascx starting at Line 148, there is an if statement which disables the three checkboxes below the TC ddl.

They are disabled when selected.Length > 0, or in other words, when there is nothing selected in the ddl.

Since they are disabled, PID 126119 does not show since he is referred, and the referred checkbox is disabled.

I commented out the line of code disabling the checkboxes, and now PID 126119 DOES show. Idk if gtetting rid of the lines will break something else, which is why I commented them out instead of deleting them.
