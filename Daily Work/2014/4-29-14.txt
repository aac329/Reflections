Watched an a long video in the NAU EC Brand folder in the EC Training: EC Organizational Strategy Course.
Went into the EC Training: Job Knowledge and skills. Watched a video about the EUM Voicemail System  underneath the Technology tab.
I also watched a video  labeled "Unofficial Evaluation Training" in the same course previously mentioned.

Zartan kept timing out, after havign to wait 25-30 minutes during each try.
