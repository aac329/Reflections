The ID's for each event in the calender is being set to null, which threw the exception in the Get Method in StreamingEventController.cs. I made the parameter a nullable type, however it still isn't displaying the information of the event so that you can edit and save it. As for the save button, the ng-click was referencing an addTicket, instead of an updateTicket js function. I'm not sure if this is proper for an event where we just want to edit instead of create a new one.
