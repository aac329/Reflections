I need to make the get method work so that someone can 'Get' the right event when the modal appears.
Also, the ID of the events aren't be set before they're ran through the ToDbEvent method in the extensionmethods.cs. I'm not sure exactly when ID's are being set.
Since I can;t 'Get' the right events, I can't 'update' the events. Another problem is that the Save button is set to 'Add' instead of 'update' when you click on an already existing event, which needs to be fixed.

ToDo: 'Get' method to make right events appear. THEN focus on Streaming_Live_Event_Id and when it's set. THEN work on 'Update' and 'Add' (when id != update?).
