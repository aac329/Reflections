Spent awhile trying to figure out a 403 Error that I was getting when trying to access local. 
Fixed the problem and got back to my task. I changed the AutoPostBack from True to False in both
viewtask.aspx and quicktask.aspx underneath the assignee divs.
This makes it so you can select multiple assignees for a task.
