Set up some javascript so that the modals have a 100% width for phones. Also, the edit TSCs modal was pushed together, so I edited some html 
so that it appears beautifully on phones. I believed I have finished with the Manager view, however I'll double check it with Ryan tomorrow. 
Added new Navbar to Requester view. Added new Navbar to TSC (Manage Tickets) view. Organized manage tickets sorting DDLs. Organized the tickets on 
Manage Tickets, and got it looking really good. I need to move around a couple icons tomorrow but I should finish this task tomorrow.
