Switched manager status to 'N'. Results:

The tab wouldn't show up on the Requester or Manager view, however you could still hit the Manager view, which needs to be changed.

I changed the if statement in the controller to include a portion checking if the User is a Manager.

Now if the User isn't a Manager, it will redirect them to the Requester View.

I changed my active status from 'A' to 'I'. 

The tab list didn't appear in the Requester view. (with Manager = 'N' and status = 'I', that's the view I can see)
