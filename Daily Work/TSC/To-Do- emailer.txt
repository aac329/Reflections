Emails need to be sent to initial assignees upon creation.

If anything changes on the ticket or if the campus is changed on the ticket, send an email to the TSC(s).

If campus is changed, email new and old TSCs, since a new TSC might appear with a new campus.

Email should include previous and new settings for each attribute changed AND the name of the user making the changes.
