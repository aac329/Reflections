    <h2>Welcome to the 2NAU Information Session</h2> <hr /> <br />

    <h3>What is 2NAU?</h3>

    <p>2NAU is a Joint Admission program. <br /> <br />

    <i>What does ‘Joint Admission’ mean?</i> <br />
    That means you are admitted to NAU while you earn your associate degree at your community college. <br /> <br />

    <i>What does that mean for me?</i> <br />
    As a 2NAU student, you receive guidance throughout your educational career so that you stay on track to complete your bachelor’s degree at NAU. <br /> <br />
