    <h2>Dialogue between a 2NAU	Transition Coordinator and a 2NAU student:</h2> <hr />

    <p>TC: So I understand you’re having difficulty deciding on a major. I have a
        few resources that I think you might be interested in, which will help you
        narrow it down a little bit. But before I do that, I just want to talk with you
        to see if we can narrow down what your interests are, and maybe get an idea
        of what your career preferences are.</p>

    <p>Student: Well I’m just not sure. I know I really like working with people. I
        like giving back to the community.</p>

    <p>TC: What type of work environment do you think you see yourself working
        in? Office, teaching, maybe even outdoors?</p>

    <p>Student: I think I’d like to work in an office climate that is truly making a
        difference.</p>

    <p>TC: Okay, so are you thinking maybe social work, or working in the medical
        field? What does making a difference mean to you?</p>

    <p>Student: I think if I really had to pick an ideal fit for me, it would be to work
        in the medical profession. But not necessarily a nurse or a doctor – I don’t
        really like needles – so more on the administrative side. Helping people to
        connect to the right resource</p>

    <p>TC: Okay, I do have a degree program in mind in our health professions that
        I think might be a good fit for you. It’s a bachelor’s of science in health
        sciences with an emphasis in public health. It’s basically designed for people
        such as yourself who are interested in working in the medical area and
        health, but not necessarily as a practitioner in a certain field. It’ll prepare you
        for working in various roles such as behavioral health, nutrition, injury
        prevention, things like that. One of our graduates ended up pursuing a
        master of administration degree and got a job as a director for health
        promotions in Yavapai county. So not only will this degree in public health
        help you to pursue a career that you might enjoy, but also if in the future
        you’re interested in a graduate degree, it’ll help you go that way as well.
        Does this sound like something you might be interested in?</p>

    <p>Student: This sounds really interesting. I’d like to learn more about this.</p>

    <p>TC: Alright, let me go ahead and give you those resources such as O-NET
        and the Bureau of Labor and Statistic site, which will give you further insight
        as to the career opportunities available for working in public health.</p>

    <p>Student: Okay, sounds good!</p>
