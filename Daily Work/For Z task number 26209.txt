getEvent: function (id) { return $http({ method: 'GET', url: 'ScheduleMethods.aspx/GetEvent', data: id, headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' } }); }

getTickets: function () { return $http.get(url); },


The first line of code is a working version of an angular get function, which can be found in ScheduleApp.js, in the java script folder under Streaming Media

The second line of code is the angular in our _ManageAssignedTickets.cshtml file where we've been having problems.

Dylan wrote the first line, and he said he's working on it more. This might be the best starting point.
